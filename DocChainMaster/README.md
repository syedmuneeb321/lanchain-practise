# LangChain Project: Document Processing Chains

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the use of LangChain for various document processing tasks. The focus is on implementing and exploring different document processing chains, including summarization, MapReduce, and refining outputs. Below is a detailed overview of the project structure.

## **Repository Structure**

### **1. 1_Text_Summarizer.ipynb**
- **Purpose**: Demonstrates the use of LangChain for text summarization.
- **Key Features**:
  - Creating efficient summarization workflows.
  - Managing and processing large text inputs for concise outputs.
- **Relevant Chains**: `StuffDocumentsChain` for straightforward summarization tasks.

---

### **2. 2_LangSwap.ipynb**
- **Purpose**: Focuses on handling multilingual documents and processing workflows involving language translation or swapping.
- **Key Features**:
  - Translating text between languages.
  - Maintaining accuracy and context during translation tasks.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Summarization and processing of multilingual datasets.

---

### **3. 3_StuffDocumentsChain.ipynb**
- **Purpose**: Explores the `StuffDocumentsChain`, where multiple documents are combined into a single prompt and processed together.
- **Key Features**:
  - Handling multiple documents within the LLM’s context window.
  - Best suited for small-scale datasets that can be processed in one pass.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Tasks requiring holistic analysis of multiple documents.

---

### **4. 4_LangChain_MapReduce_Practice.ipynb**
- **Purpose**: Implements the `MapReduceDocumentsChain` for processing large datasets by splitting them into smaller chunks.
- **Key Features**:
  - Applying a two-step process: `Map` for individual document processing and `Reduce` for synthesizing results.
  - Efficient handling of large datasets that exceed the LLM’s context window.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Summarizing or extracting insights from large collections of documents.

## **Key Concepts Covered**

### **Document Chains Implemented**
1. **StuffDocumentsChain**:
   - Combines all documents into a single input and processes them together.
   - Suitable for small-scale datasets.

2. **MapReduceDocumentsChain**:
   - Processes individual documents first, then synthesizes their results.
   - Ideal for large-scale datasets requiring parallel and sequential processing.

3. **RefineDocumentsChain**:
   - Sequentially processes documents, refining the output iteratively with each additional document.
   - Produces high-quality results but is computationally expensive.

1. **Clone the repository** to access the Jupyter notebooks.
2. **Explore each notebook** to understand how specific chains are implemented and can be customized for your use case.
3. **Experiment with prompts and configurations** to optimize the workflows for your needs.

## **Future Enhancements**

- Incorporating more advanced document chains and use cases.
- Adding examples with API integrations for real-world applications.
- Exploring further optimizations for large-scale document processing.
