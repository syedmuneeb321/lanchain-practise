## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to practicing with vector databases and understanding core data processing concepts. The focus is on learning to effectively load documents, apply splitting techniques, generate embeddings, and store them in a vector database for fast retrieval. All work is done in Colab notebooks, making it easy to experiment, modify, and run code in an interactive environment.

---

## Objectives

The primary goals of this practice repository are:

1. **Document Loading**: Practice loading various document types for preprocessing.
2. **Text Splitting**: Experiment with splitting strategies to break down large documents.
3. **Embedding Techniques**: Explore different embeddings to represent text as vectors.
4. **Vector Database Operations**: Understand vector database interactions for efficient, similarity-based retrieval.

---

## Key Concepts Covered

### 1. **Document Loading**
   - Practice loading documents in various formats and preparing them for processing in vector databases.

### 2. **Text Splitting**
   - Use different splitting strategies (e.g., sentence or paragraph) to ensure optimal storage and retrieval within vector DB.

### 3. **Embedding Techniques**
   - Convert text into vector representations using embeddings, with models like OpenAI or Hugging Face.

### 4. **Vector Database Operations**
   - Experiment with vector DBs (e.g., Pinecone, FAISS) for storing and retrieving embeddings efficiently.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For core implementations.
- **Colab Notebooks**: To make the practice interactive and easy to test.
- **Vector Databases**: Practicing with FAISS, Pinecone, or other vector stores.
- **Embedding Models**: Using OpenAI, Hugging Face models, etc., to generate vector embeddings.

## Project Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/practise-with-vector-db.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Use Poetry or pip:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   # or
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**:
   Set up your API keys in a `.env` file:
   ```dotenv
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key
   ```

4. **Run in Colab**:
   Open each Colab notebook within the repository and follow the instructions to explore document loading, splitting, embedding, and storing in vector databases.

---

## Colab Notebooks

The repository includes the following Colab notebooks for each core concept:

- **Load Documents**: `load_documents_colab.ipynb`
- **Text Splitter**: `text_splitter_colab.ipynb`
- **Generate Embeddings**: `embed_text_colab.ipynb`
- **Vector DB Storage and Retrieval**: `vector_db_colab.ipynb`

Each notebook is designed to work independently for easy exploration.

---

## Usage

Run each notebook to explore different functionalities. Detailed explanations and comments in each notebook will guide you through the process.

- **Document Loading**: `load_documents_colab.ipynb` demonstrates loading documents and preparing text.
- **Text Splitting**: `text_splitter_colab.ipynb` applies splitting strategies for large documents.
- **Embeddings**: `embed_text_colab.ipynb` generates embeddings for text.
- **Vector DB**: `vector_db_colab.ipynb` stores and retrieves embeddings for similarity-based search.

---

## Examples

1. **Load and Split a Document**:
   Open `load_documents_colab.ipynb` and `text_splitter_colab.ipynb` to load and split your documents.

2. **Embed Text and Store in Vector DB**:
   Follow `embed_text_colab.ipynb` and `vector_db_colab.ipynb` for embedding text and storing it in a vector DB.

3. **Search and Retrieve**:
   Use `vector_db_colab.ipynb` to query the vector database for similar text segments.

---

## Future Learning Goals

- Experiment with larger datasets and test embedding models for retrieval quality.
- Explore persistent storage options for vector DBs to retain data across sessions.
- Try different splitting strategies to find the best approach for each dataset type.
