## Overview

This repository is solely for practicing and experimenting with Langchain. It serves as a sandbox environment where I can explore Langchain's components, test its capabilities, and experiment with AI workflows using language models and retrieval systems. The code here may be experimental and is not intended for production use.

---

## Objectives

The primary goals of this practice repository are:

- To learn how to work with Langchain’s **core modules**: Chains, Agents, and Memory.
- To experiment with **integrations with large language models** and learn prompt engineering.
- To understand **vector embeddings** and practice building retrieval-based applications.
- To gain hands-on experience with **different Langchain components** in isolated, manageable scripts.

---

## Technologies

- **Langchain**: The main framework used for creating pipelines with language models and retrieval systems.
- **Python**: For scripting and implementing Langchain-based examples.
- **Vector Databases** (e.g., FAISS): For practicing similarity search and embedding-based retrieval.
- **LLM APIs**: APIs from providers like OpenAI and Hugging Face, used to power language model responses.

## Project Setup

To set up the project locally:

1. **Clone this Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/langchain-practise.git
   cd langchain-practise
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   It’s recommended to use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   Set up any API keys for Langchain and vector database connections in a `.env` file:
   ```dotenv
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   VECTOR_DB_API_KEY=your_vector_db_api_key
   ```

4. **Run Example Scripts**:
   Navigate to the `examples` folder and execute any script to see Langchain in action:
   ```bash
   python examples/sample_chain.py
   ```

---

## Usage

This repository is organized with sample code for various Langchain functionalities:

- **Sample Chains**: Basic Langchain chains to understand sequential flow.
- **Embedding and Retrieval**: Example scripts using vector embeddings to perform similarity searches.
- **Agent Practise**: Basic implementations of Langchain agents to interact with external tools or APIs.

Each script in the `examples/` directory is intended to run as a standalone program, making it easier to test and understand Langchain components independently.

## Future Practice Ideas

- Practice building **custom chains and agents** for more complex workflows.
- Experiment with **memory integration** for context-aware conversational agents.
- Test **embedding-based applications** with different vector databases.
